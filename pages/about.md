## About the Collection

This collection displays the last photos I took of my childhood home in Florida. I lived in that house from 2001 to 2022. I will be using this collection to record these photos of mi casita azul and reminisce about my family's time in Florida. This collection can also be used as:

- a family photo album
- future historic photos of suburban homes from the early 2000's to early 2020's

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
